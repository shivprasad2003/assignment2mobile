                <p><span class="highlight">Swami Vivekananda</span> (1863–1902) was a prominent Indian monk, spiritual leader, and philosopher who played a pivotal role in introducing Hindu philosophy to the Western world. Born as Narendranath Datta in Calcutta (now Kolkata), he was drawn to spirituality from a young age. At 18, he met his spiritual mentor, <span class="highlight">Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa</span>, and became a devoted disciple. After Ramakrishna's passing, Vivekananda embarked on a journey across India as a wandering monk, gaining firsthand insight into the country's social and economic challenges.</p>
